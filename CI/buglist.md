## Bugs that I found with my nose

  - eventListenerStop: while can be replaced with foreach.
  - alternateResourcesStart: unnecessary array for vararg ( 5625 )
  - loadOnStartup: parameter "children" declared in C-style array ( 5708 )
  - contextListenerStop: it's more readable to use an iterator or to build a new list and reverse it.
  - addEnvironment: never used
  - addResource: never used
  - addResourceLink: never used
  - redundant assignment at line `7498`
  - redundant assignment at line `7545`
  - redundant assignment at line `7559`
  - getState: should return an enum or a class

>          saving value returned from `getString` call into a local variable
>          should solve those problems.
