## Scope
Glashfish is the official implementation of JEE. It is an open source project that uses svn as version system, in fact we used it to retrieve a specif version of glashfish: 64219 (of 16 Oct 2015 05:11).  
This version is required by the assignment text since we have some methods of this version assigned to us to check.  
Glashfish is a maven project, in fact we imported the pom file into intellij IDEA and we used it and sonar to test some check of the checklist. **KEEP OR REMOVE?**
