#Description of the given problem
We will project and implement myTaxiService, which is a service based on mobile applications and web applications, with two different targets of people:

* taxi driver
* clients

The system allows clients to reserve taxi via mobile or web app, using GPS position to identify client's zone and find taxi in the same zone. On the other side the app allows taxi to accept or reject a reservation.

The system includes extra services and functionalities such as taxi sharing
##Actual system
Until now the taxi company has a system where the clients have to call a call center communicating its position via voice (so it cannot be correct), the call center's operator inserts the request into an internal information system and the taxi driver can accept or reject it via a dedicated hardware device.

The system sends automatically an SMS to the client with the estimated arrival time and the taxi name

#Goals
The main goal of the system is decreasing costs and creating a more efficient and precise service.

The main features are:

##Taxi drivers:
* allow taxi drivers to sign up into the system
* log in
* say they are avaiable
* able to accept or decline a request

##Users:
* taxi sharing
* precise the origin
* 

#Domain properties
* if taxi accepts the ride he do it
* if user request the taxi he takes it
* GPS gives the right position
