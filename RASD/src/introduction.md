#Description of the given problem
We will project and implement myTaxiService, which is a service based on mobile applications and a web applications, with two different target of people:

* taxi driver
* clients

The system allow clients to reserve taxi via mobile or web app, using GPS position to identify client's zone and find taxi in the same zone. On the other side the app allow to taxi to accept or reject a reservation.

The system includes extra services and functionalities such as taxi sharing
##Actual system
Until now the taxi company has a system where the clients have to call a call center communicating its position via voice (so it can be not correct), the call center's operator insert the request into an internal information system and the taxi driver can accept or reject it via an dedicated hardware device.

The system sen automatically an SMS to the client with the estimated arrival time and the taxi name

#Goals
The main goal the system is decrease costs and create a more efficient and precise service.

The main features are:

##Taxi drivers:
* allow taxi drivers to sign up into the system
* log in
* say they are avaiable
* able to accept or decline a request

##Users:
* taxi sharing
* precise the origin
* 

#Domain properties
* taxi drivers already registered to the old system
* if taxi accepts the ride he do it
* if user request the taxi he takes it
* GPS gives the right position
* taxi drivers answer in less than 5 minutes
